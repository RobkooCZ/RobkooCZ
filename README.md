## Current Main Project

<pre>
Flight Simulator
────────────────

The Game
────────
• Fully written in C with SDL2  
• Basic 2D GUI in place  
• Plane controls and flight physics already functional  
• Custom flight model built from scratch  
• Designed to support future 3D rendering and physics engine  
• No external engines or bloated libs — all raw  

The Website
────────────
• Built with PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL  
• Functional login and registration system    
• No frameworks — backend is fully hand-coded  
</pre>

The Game
────────
• Write a physics engine in raw C  
• Build a 3D renderer with OpenGL and SDL2  
• Possibly build a software renderer or framebuffer version later

The Website
────────────
• Integrate with the game through a custom API  
• Stats tracking, leaderboards, and user data sync  
• Expand and harden the PHP backend (still fully custom)  
• A unified account system between game and site
